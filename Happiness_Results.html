<h2> SUMMARY AND RESULTS
 </h2> </Div>
<h2> <u>TIME SERIES SKEWS $ TRENDS</u></h2>
<Div id="rb3">
  
 TIME SERIES Analysis show a distinct skew or peak in the summer holiday season  This is to be expected as lots of people  travel to Europe during this time.

Less expcted/popular trends however show peaks in winter, this is mostly  by businessmen likely travelling to take advantage of the Christmas shopping discounts and holiday bonuses!

We also notice a rise in customer numbers sending money to others abroad, most probably to students for tickets back home away from the winter's cold; or for grand occasions, like weddings, that usually take place at this season. 
  

<h4><u> CORRELATION </u></h4>
There is at least a 45% correlation between the Happiness Index and Average Regional Latitudes when the countries are divided into their individual regions. This further increases to 46% when Scandinavian countries are grouped differently from other Northern European countries. Therefore only about 22% of the change in Index Scores can be attributed to difference in Latitude or distance from the equator. Correlation results using Average Regional temperature are similar with 46% and 48% respectively. Using This is to be expected as the main factors influencing happiness have bn estblishd.
