<h2>SAMPLING AND DATA COLLECTION </h2>

<Div id="rb2">
  
The data collected for this project is secondary data and was obtained from reliable sources such as Kaggle.com and government websites.  They were Extracted by using Excel's 'GET and TRANSFORM' Data tools.                                                                            
The data basically consists of mostly numerical data, often ranked variables, for easy computations, but also features Nominal, Ordinal and Boolean data classes comprising decimal, date, and variable-character datatypes.

<h2> CLEANING THE DATA </h2>
<Div id="rb2">
  The data was cleaned using Microsoft Excel's most wonderful 'FILTER' tool alongside the 'FIND $ REPLACE', the 'DELETE' and the 'SORT' tools in addition to other editors; by
removing bogus and ambiguous data, erasing duplicate records and deleting or correcting other inconsistencies such as those in naming conventions or simple typographical errors.
Finally, missing values were totally filtered off.

<h2> SAMPLING </h2>

<Div id="rb3">
Sampling is the process of using statistical estimates computations from small subsets of a popuation to make inferences about that population. These selected subsets ought to properly represent the population as much as possible and not be biased. It is classified into random nd non-random sampling types. Random sampling includes Simple, Stratified, Cluster sampling. Non-random sampling comprises quota and convenience sampling. This project uses sampling based only on participation in all available surveys carried out by the Gallup Poll team for the purpose of scoring happiness. It therefore consists a large sample, about 90% of the entire population.

<h2> BUILDING THE SQL DATABASE </h2>
<Div id="rb3">

Next, the SQL Database was built using the cleaned data. This was done by creating useful tables, views, indexes among other tools using SQL queries based on the Key Performance Indicators to meet the Research objectives. 
The SQL software used for the project is the Microsoft SQL Server.
The queries used to build the database include both simple and complex queries and utilise a wide variety of SQL tools and clauses such as <i>
'SELECT', 'FROM', 'WITH', 'UNION', 'TOP', 'AVG', 'GROUP BY' and 'ORDER BY' </i> among others.
