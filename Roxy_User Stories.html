<h2>  <u>USER STORIES</u></h2>
<Div id="rb3">

User stories are basically, tools used by agile software developers to get directions about the product they are creating from the customers. They are an opportunity for users to fully describe in detail their exact product specifications based on its functionality and benefit.
 This, together with the list or sequence of next steps to be taken by the product owner and his team, make up the story features. They are best represented in tables. <br><br>


Data Analysis, presents a slightly different view and variation, the request being basically a performance review of the customer's business, wherein, the customer requires an offering, and not a physical product.
 It features the customer's business request or questions, and the answers obtained by the analyst throughout the research, and finally the optimization strategy proffered by the analyst. Furthermore it features  the performance summaries expressed as charts and dashboards for attractive Visualization.

<h4><u> STATISTICS</u> </u></h4>

Statistics are figures calculated from analysis of datasets. 
They can be in group or singular and summarise or represent the data in question or a particular characteristic of it. They are categorised into two main groups being Descriptive Statistics which describe the central tendaency, the dispersion or the skewness of the dataset eg mean, mode; and Inferential Statistics which make inferences about population from small dataets and predict future possible outcomes eg the T-test.


<br>
<h4><u> DATA ANALYTICS </u> </u></h4>
Analytics is the sytematic analysis of data or statistics for the discovery, interpetation and communication of useful insights and meaningful pattern.
They are grouped into four main categories being: Descriptive, diagnostic, Prescriptive and Predictive.
Each User Story fits under one of such groupings and it is necessary to know which one it is. 
The table below places each User Story in its appropriate group and also describe their SQL Queries using thumbnail images which popup into full-size images upon clicking.
