<b style="font-size: 22pt;"> PURPOSE </b> 
<Div id="a4">
<p style="font-size: 22pt;">
The main purpose of the Tables Scheme is to specify the appropriate data types to use for the data research and to specify integer ranges, in view of setting constraints to prevent mistakes and outliers. 

But it is also a means for identifying, and a source of obtaining useful and invaluable information about the company and its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

It is used furthermore, for identifying professional working terms which differ from industry to industry, company to company and analyst to analyst.</p>
